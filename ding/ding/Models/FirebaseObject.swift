/**
 Each object that would be stored in Firebase database is a `FirebaseObject`. This protocol
 provides the basic capability, such as serialization.

 `FirebaseObject` conforms to `Codable` protocol. This is because we can think of Firebase
 database as a cloud-hosted JSON tree. Thus, it would be nice if we could use `Codable` types,
 which can be easily converted from/to JSON objects.

 `FirebaseObject` conforms to `Hashable` protocol. This is because each JSON node in Firebase
 database has a key, which should be unique. Thus, a certain `FirebaseObject` is identifiable
 by its key value, the `id` attribute.
